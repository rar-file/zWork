# Changelog

All notable changes to zWork are documented here.

## v0.3.11

- Restored macOS drag regions while removing the duplicate drag strip from Windows layouts.
- Replaced the homepage glow with the same ray background direction as onboarding, coming up from the bottom.
- Cleaned artifact rendering so the model no longer emits the stray `Text` / `Open` / `undefined` code block before artifact cards.
- Removed the hidden tooltip from the collapsed sidebar expand button.

## v0.3.10

**Make telemetry default-on and fix update handoff.**

- Enabled anonymous telemetry by default for new installs while keeping the opt-out toggle in Settings
- Removed the onboarding telemetry opt-in step so users do not have to answer it during setup
- Fixed the update card fallback so clicking it opens the release page reliably when native install is unavailable
- Added a visible opening state so the updater does not appear to do nothing after a click

## v0.3.9

**Remove broken landing particles and add anonymous analytics opt-in.**

- Removed the broken landing particle renderer and the duplicate top drag strip
- Added an explicit anonymous analytics opt-in with a clear privacy disclosure
- Added anonymous telemetry for app open/close, active session time, onboarding completion, chat turn counts, settings changes, and update success/failure
- Kept message content, files, API keys, screenshots, and paths out of telemetry

## v0.3.8

**Fix Windows backend startup encoding.**

- Forced the backend process to use UTF-8 I/O on Windows so startup logs cannot crash the packaged Python server
- Changed the startup banner to ASCII-safe text so the backend can launch cleanly under cp1252 consoles
- Applied the UTF-8 environment settings to both packaged and dev backend launchers

## v0.3.7

**Tighten updater UX and fix app shell shortcuts.**

- Added visible version info in Settings
- Simplified the update card copy and layout to a compact current-version -> latest-version prompt
- Added real in-app updater progress states so Update now no longer appears to flash and reset
- Added a post-update changelog notice after relaunch
- Fixed the duplicate `Cmd+K` handler that could immediately close search
- Added a dedicated top drag strip so the window is easier to move

## v0.3.6

**Remove chat-load flashes and harden long-running streams.**

- Removed the centered loading-card transition when sending the first message from the landing screen
- Slowed the rotating in-thread working copy to a 5-second cadence instead of rapid cycling
- Added SSE heartbeat events and stricter stream finalization so long skill/tool turns do not silently die in the UI
- Tightened the landing logo-particle field into a denser square composition instead of stretching it across one axis

## v0.3.5

**Fix landing particle renderer boot.**

- Fixed the landing particle canvas initializing at `0px` height in fill mode, which could make the home screen look blank
- Kept the particle renderer code-split so the landing fix does not bloat the main app bundle
- Preserved lower-motion behavior without falling back to a fully static logo

## v0.3.4

**Harden desktop state isolation and chat streaming.**

- Isolated packaged desktop state from `~/.zwork` so installed builds no longer inherit local dev/session data
- Turned dropped local chat streams into in-app backend errors instead of surfacing raw `TypeError: Load failed`
- Kept onboarding on `LightRays` while restoring the logo particle backdrop on the empty home screen

## v0.3.3

**Patch macOS backend resource path and onboarding visual.**

- Swapped onboarding to the React Bits LightRays visual backed by `ogl`

**Patch universal macOS backend launch and restore optimized onboarding dither.**

- Shipped both Intel and Apple Silicon backend binaries inside the universal app
- Restored the onboarding dither as a low-resolution canvas renderer instead of WebGL
- Centered the “Your agent for…” visual within the left onboarding area
- Added backend readiness retry and clearer onboarding setup errors

## v0.3.1

- Replaced the onboarding WebGL dither background with a lightweight CSS backdrop

- Repaired stale/default model selection after onboarding and provider refreshes
